Smart Stop-List:
From http://www.lextek.com/manuals/onix/stopwords2.html (archived on Internet Archive) - 
>>  This stopword list was built by Gerard Salton and Chris Buckley for the experimental SMART 
    information retrieval system at Cornell University. This stopword list is generally considered 
    to be on the larger side and so when it is used, some implementations edit it so that it is 
    better suited for a given domain and audience while others use this stopword list as it stands. 
    This wordlist is 571 words in length.
