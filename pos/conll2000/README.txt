From the link:

The train and test data consist of three columns separated by spaces. Each word has been put on a separate line and there is an empty line after each sentence. The first column contains the current word, the second its part-of-speech tag as derived by the Brill tagger and the third its chunk tag as derived from the WSJ corpus. The chunk tags contain the name of the chunk type, for example I-NP for noun phrase words and I-VP for verb phrase words. Most chunk types have two types of chunk tags, B-CHUNK for the first word of the chunk and I-CHUNK for each other word in the chunk. Here is an example of the file format:

   He        PRP  B-NP
   reckons   VBZ  B-VP
   the       DT   B-NP
   current   JJ   I-NP
   account   NN   I-NP
   deficit   NN   I-NP
   will      MD   B-VP
   narrow    VB   I-VP
   to        TO   B-PP
   only      RB   B-NP
   #         #    I-NP
   1.8       CD   I-NP
   billion   CD   I-NP
   in        IN   B-PP
   September NNP  B-NP
   .         .    O

The O chunk tag is used for tokens which are not part of any chunk. Instead of using the part-of-speech tags of the WSJ corpus, the data set used tags generated by the Brill tagger. The performance with the corpus tags will be better but it will be unrealistic since for novel text no perfect part-of-speech tags will be available. The first two columns have been extracted from the [RM95] NP chunking data which is available from: ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/chunker/
